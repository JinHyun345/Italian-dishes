                Tomato sauce can refer to many different sauces made 
                primarily from tomatoes, usually to be served as part of
                a dish, rather than as a condiment. Tomato sauces are 
                common for meat and vegetables, but they are perhaps best
                known as bases for sauces for Mexican salsas and Italian
                pasta dishes.
